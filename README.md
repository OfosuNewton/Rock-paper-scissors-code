# Rock-paper-scissors-code
A simple Rock Paper Scissors game developed in JavaScript as part of The Odin Project Foundations curriculum. This project focuses on using JavaScript logic to simulate a classic game and is entirely played within the browser console.

🚀 Features
Text-based input from the player via prompt.

Random move generation for the computer.

Game logic that determines the winner of each round.

Score tracking and a game-over message once a player reaches 5 points.

🧠 What I Learned
Writing and structuring functions in JavaScript.

Using Math.random() for randomness.

Handling user input through the console.

Applying conditionals, loops, and string comparisons.

Organizing game logic with clean, readable code.

🎮 How to Play
Open your browser's developer console (F12 or right-click → Inspect → Console tab).

Run the game script.

When prompted, type your move: "rock", "paper", or "scissors".

The computer randomly selects its move.

The result of the round is logged in the console.

The first to 5 points wins the game!
